# HPB_tools

Various bits of code written to carry out numerical calculations of atomic energy levels, state admixtures, and more for alkali-metal species in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime.

Currently tested for rubidium (n = 5) in experiments realised in QLM @ Durham University.

`atomdata`: Simple database of atomic structure constants for use in calculations.

`uncoupledbasis`: Code for numerically calculating the atomic energy levels, as well as the state admixtures, at a given magnetic field strength. Also used for generating energy-level diagrams as a function of magnetic field.

`durhamcolours`: Custom colour codes for use in plotting.

*Additional details coming soon...*
